# Image Generation Fix Guide

## Problem Identified
The image generation feature was not working correctly because:
1. **Environment variable mismatch**: The config was looking for `STABILITY_API_KEY` but the setup guide specified `STABILITY_AI_KEY`
2. **Missing image display logic**: Generated images weren't being displayed in the chat interface
3. **Restrictive image prompt detection**: Only very specific prompt formats were recognized as image requests

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Environment Variable Configuration
- ✅ Updated `backend/config.js` to use `STABILITY_AI_KEY` instead of `STABILITY_API_KEY`
- ✅ This matches the environment variable name specified in the setup guides

### 2. Added Image Display Logic
- ✅ Updated `ChatGPTInterface.tsx` to properly render generated images
- ✅ Added responsive image display with proper styling
- ✅ Images are displayed below the message content with a maximum height of 400px

### 3. Improved Image Prompt Detection
- ✅ Enhanced the image prompt detection logic to recognize more variations:
  - `image:` (original)
  - `/image` (original)
  - `generate image`
  - `create image`
  - `draw`
  - `paint`

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- ✅ Improved assistant message for image generation to show "Here's the image you requested:"
- ✅ Added proper error handling and user feedback

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create .env File
Create a `.env` file in your `backend` directory with the following content:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/bharat-ai

# Email Configuration (for OTP)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000

# OpenRouter API Configuration (for AI chat)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your-actual-openrouter-api-key-here

# Stability AI Configuration (for image generation)
STABILITY_AI_KEY=sk-your-actual-stability-ai-key-here

# JWT Secret (for authentication)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
```

### Step 2: Get Stability AI API Key
1. Visit [Stability AI](https://platform.stability.ai/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Go to your API keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy your API key
6. Replace `sk-your-actual-stability-ai-key-here` in the `.env` file with your actual API key

### Step 3: Restart the Backend
After creating the `.env` file, restart your backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Image Generation
1. Start both frontend and backend servers
2. Login to your application
3. Try these image generation prompts:
   - "Generate image: a beautiful sunset"
   - "Create image of a cat"
   - "Draw a house"
   - "Paint a landscape"

## How It Works Now

### Image Prompt Detection
The system now detects image generation requests based on these keywords:
- `image:` - Direct image request
- `/image` - Command-style request
- `generate image` - Natural language request
- `create image` - Alternative phrasing
- `draw` - Drawing request
- `paint` - Painting request

### API Flow
1. **Frontend** detects image prompt keywords
2. **Frontend** sends request to `/api/generate-image` endpoint
3. **Backend** calls Stability AI API with the prompt
4. **Backend** returns base64-encoded image
5. **Frontend** displays the image in the chat interface

### Image Display
- Images are displayed below the assistant's message
- Maximum height of 400px for better UI
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Proper styling with rounded corners and shadows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Stability API key not configured" error:**
   - Ensure your `.env` file has `STABILITY_AI_KEY` set
   - Restart your backend server after adding the API key

2. **Images not displaying:**
   - Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
   - Verify that the image URL is being returned from the API
   - Ensure the image data is valid base64

3. **Image generation not triggered:**
   - Make sure your prompt contains one of the recognized keywords
   - Check that the frontend is properly detecting image prompts

4. **Network errors:**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify that Stability AI API is accessible
   - Check your API key validity

### Testing the API
You can test the image generation API directly using the provided test script:

```bash
cd backend
node test-image-generation.js
```

## Cost Considerations

Stability AI charges per image generation:
- Check your Stability AI dashboard for current pricing
- Monitor your usage to manage costs
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Support

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for frontend errors
2. Check the backend server logs for API errors
3. Verify your Stability AI API key and account status
4. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
5. Test with the provided test script

The improved system now provides better user experience with more flexible prompt detection and proper image display.
